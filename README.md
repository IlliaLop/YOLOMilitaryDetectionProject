Once detected, notifications are sent via WhatsApp through Twilio with the snapshot and a brief report. It supports both real-time monitoring and batch processing of pre-recorded footage. Designed for legal and ethical use in monitoring and analysis tasks. Users are responsible for complying with local laws and privacy regulations.
